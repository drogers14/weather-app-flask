# Weather Machine

I built this simple weather machine using new and familiar tools and technologies since I was so curious to try out some new things.

**New:**
- Flask
- Adobe Illustrator

**Familiar:**
- React
- GCP

## If you would like to run locally:

    - npm install
    - npm run start
    - npm run start-backend
